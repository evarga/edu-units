# Overview
This is an umbrella project for centralizing access to various self-contained educational units from different domains, like software engineering, parallel and distributed computing, computer science, etc. The key benefits from this approach are as follows:

- **Centralized Overview**: An umbrella project allows visitors to see all linked projects in one place, making it easier to navigate and understand the scope of each individual learning material.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: It may include more detailed explanations about the learning objectives, technologies used, and the outcomes of each project.
- **Increased Visibility**: GitHub limits the number of pinned repositories to 6, so this approach allows for more projects to be highlighted.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Updating information or adding new projects becomes more streamlined when managed through a single repository.

The GitHub Pages based website for this project contains a list of all the linked projects, along with a brief description and a link to the respective repository. The website is accessible by following the link displayed in the right sidebar of this repository.
