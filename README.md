# Overview
This is an umbrella project for centralizing access to various self-contained educational units from different domains, like software engineering, parallel and distributed computing, computer science, etc. The key benefits from this approach are as follows:

- **Centralized Overview**: An umbrella project allows visitors to see all linked projects in one place, making it easier to navigate and understand the scope of each individual learning material.
- **Increased Visibility**: GitHub limits the number of pinned repositories to 6, so this approach allows for more projects to be highlighted.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Updating information or adding new projects becomes more streamlined when managed through a single repository.
- **Community Contributions**: This project is open for contributions from the community. If you have a self-contained educational unit that you would like to share, please consider contributing it to this project. Read the [Contributors' Guide](https://github.com/evarga/edu-units/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

- **Independent Evolution**: Subprojects may evolve independently of their container website. This is particularly useful when the subprojects are maintained by different authors or teams (in case people decide to contribute their unit(s) to this project).
- **Self-Referencing Property**: This project is itself an educational unit, showcasing how to organize and present subordinate educational materials in a structured manner. More specifically, technologies like Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Markdown are used to create a website that lists all linked projects. The custom subdomain for this site was configured via the [dnsimple](https://dnsimple.com/r/fefeb14211521c) service.

The GitHub Pages based website for this project contains a list of all the linked projects, along with a brief description and a link to the respective repository. The website is accessible by following the link displayed in the right sidebar of this repository.
