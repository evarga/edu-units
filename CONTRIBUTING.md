# Contributing to Edu Units
Following the lean operating mode contributing to this project has been made as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing enhancements or domains/topics to be covered
- Proposing new educational units

## Submitting an Issue
Open a GitHub [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) to report a bug, propose an enhancement, or suggest a new domain/topic to be covered. Please be very specific in your description and provide a clear title. Also, mark the type of issue you're submitting (**bug**, **enhancement**, **domain/topic proposal**). Please, always consider how any change will impact learning experience of students.

## Submitting a Pull Request
Create a GitHub [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) as the best way to propose concrete changes to the website. The steps follow the usual GitHub flow:
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you are proposing a new educational unit, make sure it is self-contained, is original work and has clear learning objectives; take a look at any existing unit how to structure the README file. If your PR is about fixing/improving the website, make sure the changes are consistent with the overall design and the content is accurate. Always test your version locally before making a PR, [learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
3. Issue that pull request!
